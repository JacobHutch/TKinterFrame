Thoughts/Notes on Now:----------------------------------------------------------
- New commit, new me

- I fixed the squares, they actually scale the right way now

- I now need to fix the display system
  - I also would like to sort out any redundancies and temp variables I have
    before I keep going

- Playing with the sizes, I've noted that the world size can be about 2000^2
  max with the random colors, and the camera size probably shouldn't go over 75
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later:----------------------------------------------------------------
- Keep fixing the display
- Implement event loop?
- Add world gen algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Questions:----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Idk if I should run the game immediately (during init) or later after the
  class object is created: basically, should the init function act as the main
  function?

- Working on the menu function now, I'm trying to figure out how to format it
  should the menu just be in the game function?
  - I think for now I'm just gonna put it in Game.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later Later:----------------------------------------------------------
- Maybe generate an actual narrative
- Clean up the pygame stuff (it's not broken, just in the way and incomplete)
  - Pygame will be implemented after I have a more stable version for tkinter
    apps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
