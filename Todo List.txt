Thoughts/Notes on Now:----------------------------------------------------------
- New commit, new me

- I fixed the squares, they actually scale the right way now

- I now need to fix the display system
  - I also would like to sort out any redundancies and temp variables I have
    before I keep going

- Playing with the sizes, I've noted that the world size can be about 2000^2
  max with the random colors, and the camera size probably shouldn't go over 75
---
- So I'm still trying to limit the display, I fixed the index errors though

- I've noticed my code just gets worse and worse as I progress oof

- Ok I had a crazy idea: what if I make all the tiles objects? so I set them
  equal to a variable and put them in an array, then only change the colors?
  idk if that would be more or less inefficient
  - I don't think it'll be very efficient

- I lied about the tile number, it shouldn't go over 45, it can go up to around
  75 without being detrimental, but it's noticeable from 50 upwards

- I just spent 20 minutes making a function that maximizes the window when you
  press a button, and then I remembered it was pointless

- I should figure out how to pull branches

- I'm kinda thinking big right now, I might create the event loop now before I
  continue with the display. Also, I'm thinking of making the world it's own
  object, which might be overkill idk

- Ok I tried the event loop and now I'm unsure if I need it again
  - I'll figure it out Later

- I think I need to rewrite some or most of the display function

- I should probably start using branches
  - And to do that I gotta modulate some stuff
  - Nvm I don't wanna

- For my event loop I think I'll just call it with no delay, so long as it
  doesn't clog up anything

- Holy moly I actually finished the display
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later:----------------------------------------------------------------
- Keep fixing the display
- Implement event loop?
- Add world gen algorithms
- Have a narrative
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Questions:----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Idk if I should run the game immediately (during init) or later after the
  class object is created: basically, should the init function act as the main
  function?

- Should the menu just be in the game function?
  - I think for now I'm just gonna put it in Game.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later Later:----------------------------------------------------------
- Clean up the pygame stuff (it's not broken, just in the way and incomplete)
  - Pygame will be implemented after I have a more stable version for tkinter
    apps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
