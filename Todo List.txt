Thoughts/Notes on Now:----------------------------------------------------------
- I fixed the code, everything is more modular and wayyyy less messy
  - This was actually a wild undertaking I'm so proud it's all fixed up
- I'll get back to world gen soon, I have plans in mind
- The event loop is there, just unused for now
- I removed the menu because I don't want to deal with it and I never use it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later:----------------------------------------------------------------
- World Gen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Questions:----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Idk if I should run the game immediately (during init) or later after the
  class object is created: basically, should the init function act as the main
  function?
  - Yes

- Should the menu just be in the game function?
  - I think for now I'm just gonna put it in Game.py
    - Not anymore, now it's in CommandCenter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later Later:----------------------------------------------------------
- Have a narrative
- Try to use the frame as a host for pygame games
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
