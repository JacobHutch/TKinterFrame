- Add menu functionality
- Probably rewrite a lot of code
  - Figure out a better way to optimize
  - It's not quite as modular as I'd like
- Clean up the pygame stuff (it's not broken, just in the way and incomplete)
  - Pygame will be implemented after I have a more stable version for tkinter
- I want the tkframe to act as more of a module, rather than the game being the module
