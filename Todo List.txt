Thoughts/Notes on Now:----------------------------------------------------------
- Idk if I should run the game immediately (during init) or later after the
  class object is created: basically, should the init function act as the main
  function?

- Working on the menu function now, I'm trying to figure out how to format it
  should the menu just be in the game function?
  - I think for now I'm just gonna put it in Game.py

- So I added the menus directly to the game object because I need to specify
  specific variables for each menu, which idk how to do

- I made the world array, so far it's just random colors, now I have to figure
  out how to display it

- Displaying brought a whole new mass of checkboxes into light
  - I need a coordinate system
  - I need to be able to base the display off of the coordinate system
  - I have to figure out how to display the right squares

- This commit is going to be massive, idk if that's good etiquette

- I think I'm pre-optimizing my world drawing function, because I'm only
  drawing what's going to be on the screen, rather than drawing the entire
  map and moving it

- I added a movement system, which doubles as a reset function, I'm very proud
  of myself

- One side note: The frame is basically complete but I'm really interested in
  finishing this game

- I was thinking and I'm actually unsure if I need an event loop for this game
  since it's movement/event based.

- Oh my goodness I actually did something that looks good
  - I can display the world now! It's not quite perfect, I realized I have to
    rewrite a bunch of stuff anyway, but it still looks nice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later:----------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix the display function
- Implement event loop?
- Add world gen algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later Later-----------------------------------------------------------
- Maybe generate an actual narrative
- Clean up the pygame stuff (it's not broken, just in the way and incomplete)
  - Pygame will be implemented after I have a more stable version for tkinter
    apps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
