Thoughts/Notes on Now:----------------------------------------------------------
- I'm going to try and optimize more in the world display
  - I think I'll draw the world in chunks, and move it instead of recoloring
    tiles, idk which will be faster though
  - I figured it out, I'm very dumb
  - I needed to call canvas.update_idletasks() so the canvas wouldn't get
    clogged
  - World chunks are still in my head though
    - If I want to have textures, that will require smooth scrolling, which
      means I'll need to have dynamic tiles rather than 'pixels'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later:----------------------------------------------------------------
- World Gen
- Images instead of solid colors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Questions:----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Idk if I should run the game immediately (during init) or later after the
  class object is created: basically, should the init function act as the main
  function?
  - Yes

- Should the menu just be in the game function?
  - I think for now I'm just gonna put it in Game.py
    - Not anymore, now it's in CommandCenter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later Later:----------------------------------------------------------
- Have a narrative
- Try to use the frame as a host for pygame games
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
