Thoughts/Notes on Now:----------------------------------------------------------
- I have so much freedom now I don't even know where I should start
  - Wait yes I do, the world gen
    - Probably should be a new file
- For the world gen I think I'm eventually gonna move all world related
  functions to the world gen file
  - Right now I'm just keeping it as only the world gen function, but all the
    other stuff is too messy right now to change
- Everything is very inefficient, and whenever I add stuff it gets worse
- Ok hear me out: chunks
  - I made a nice thing but it's inefficient as flip
  - It's way more controlled, but what once took .03 seconds now takes 6.3
  - I didn't lower the omega value either
- Chunks will most likely take the same amount or more time to load, so I need
  a good size, probably gonna be 10x10
  - 10x10 takes .05s, and 25x25 takes ~<.5s, so I might be able to get away
    with 10x10
    - Hey I realized the print function is doubling the time
- Fixed the orientation for real this time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later:----------------------------------------------------------------
- Keep fixing the display
- Implement event loop?
- Add world gen algorithms
- Have a narrative
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Questions:----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Idk if I should run the game immediately (during init) or later after the
  class object is created: basically, should the init function act as the main
  function?

- Should the menu just be in the game function?
  - I think for now I'm just gonna put it in Game.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stuff for Later Later:----------------------------------------------------------
- Clean up the pygame stuff (it's not broken, just in the way and incomplete)
  - Pygame will be implemented after I have a more stable version for tkinter
    apps
